# **University of Minnesota---<u>CERTX465-003</u>: <br>Data Interpretation and Application (Jan 2026)**

---


## Course Information
In our data-filled world, it is important to be able to effectively interpret data and apply it to real-world problems. This six-week course will equip you with the skills to examine and understand data analyses and visualizations, and translate this into actionable insights that drive decision-making.<br><br>

**What You'll Learn**:
- **Identifying the Right Data**: Master the art of pinpointing the data you need to solve complex problems or answer critical questions within your organization. Learn how to formulate effective research questions and translate them into actionable data requests.
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Develop the critical skills to evaluate data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. You'll learn to identify potential limitations and biases in data sets, ensuring your analysis is built on a solid foundation.
- **DataDiverse Viewpoints**: Understand the importance of considering diverse perspectives when interpreting data. Learn strategies to mitigate bias and ensure your analysis reflects a well-rounded understanding of the information.
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Refine your ability to translate data insights into clear, actionable recommendations for organizational decision-making. You'll learn to communicate your findings in a way that is compelling and easy to understand for stakeholders.
- **Business Intelligence (BI) Platforms**: Learn about BI platforms commonly used to analyze and visualize data. This course will give you examples of how these tools are leveraged to communicate complex information to a broader audience.
- **Collaboration with Experts**: Develop strategies for collaborating effectively with IT and data professionals to access advanced analyses and visualizations. Learn to articulate your needs clearly and collaborate to maximize the value of data for your organization.

## Course Modules

### **<u>Week 1</u>: Start with a question**
- Sometimes you’ll start with a question and then need to find data to answer it. Other times, you will have data and need to understand how to use it to make decisions. Regardless of the starting point, it’s important to be really clear what you’re setting out to answer.
- In this module, we will learn how to identify and clearly frame problems and questions that can be addressed through quantitative data. You will think about the downstream value of the data investigation and the uses it can have for different audiences and decision-makers<br><br>

#### <u>**Assignments**</u>:
- Question identification: Think of a topic area that interests you (i.e., something you do for work, a hobby, something you enjoy). Now think about a problem or question about this topic that can be answered using data.
<br><br>

### **<u>Week 2</u>: Finding data and assessing quality**
- We will learn how to identify potential data sources to help answer a question or problem of interest. There are a lot of places to look for data. Some might contain raw data, and some might have data that’s already been tabulated or analyzed. In addition to locating data, we will discuss how to evaluate data quality and how to vet data sources to interpret what they can and cannot tell you.<br><br>

#### <u>**Assignments**</u>:
- Data source identification and assessment: Identify at least one data source that can help answer the question you developed in Module 1. First, brainstorm a bit on your own. Then, try using AI to identify data sources.
<br><br>

### **<u>Week 3</u>: Deriving insights from your data**
- In this module, we will focus on how to find key points and draw conclusions from data - the translation of information into knowledge. We will also learn how diverse perspectives can enrich and add nuance to data interpretation.<br><br>

#### <u>**Assignments**</u>:
- Data interpretation video: Using the data source(s) that you identified, produce a 5-minute video describing what you are seeing in the data and what conclusions the data is pointing towards. Make sure you tie it back to the original question you set out to address.
<br><br>

### **<u>Week 4</u>: Interpreting graphs and visuals**
- Data is sometimes presented in tables or as raw numbers, but more commonly, it is displayed as visuals. We will learn how to interpret what a data visualization is trying to convey, and how well it does at conveying that information. We will draw on principles of data visualization best practices to determine how to construct an effective visual that can be interpreted easily by different audiences.<br><br>

#### <u>**Assignments**</u>:
- Data visualization analysis: Find two data visualizations online - one that you think is a good, effective visual and one that you think is less effective. Note that these do not need to be about the same topic your other assignments have focused on.
<br><br>

### **<u>Week 5</u>: Making and presenting data-driven recommendations**
- You’ve started to glean insights from your data in Module 3. Now, we’re going to move from knowledge to wisdom by formulating strong data-driven recommendations or takeaways. We will learn about how to present these takeaways to different audiences and will apply this by drafting a brief report and oral presentation of your recommendations that are tied to your original problem or question.<br><br>

#### <u>**Assignments**</u>:
- **Report for stakeholders**:
	- <u>Part 1</u>:  You’ve developed your question, found your data, and interpreted it. Now, we’re going to put it all together. Write a brief report to a clearly-specified audience that contains at least three recommendations or takeaways that are justified by data.
	- <u>Part 2</u>: Next, record a 5-min video where you present your recommendations in a mock professional setting. This is your “elevator speech” version of your key takeaways. Provide feedback on two of your peers’ videos.
<br><br>

### **<u>Week 6</u>: Using business intelligence and dashboards**
- Business intelligence is a combination of tools and methods that allow businesses to harness data for decision making. We will learn how business intelligence might be used in an organization and what players, including IT, might be involved. We will also focus on a commonly used tool in business intelligence: dashboards, or tools that allow people to interact with a large amount of data or track changes in real time.<br><br>

#### <u>**Assignments**</u>:
- **Reflection**: Discussion board reflecting on what you learned and what you are going to take away from this class.

## Course Completion
You will receive a grade of incomplete or complete based on your demonstration of course learning objectives. Learning objectives are demonstrated by completing assessed projects.

The instructor will assess each learning outcome as “not demonstrated,” or “demonstrated.” Completion of a course means that you have demonstrated achievement of all learning outcomes. Continuing Education Units (CEUs) and the certificate of completion for the course will be awarded only if you receive a grade of ‘complete’ for the course.

While participation in Zoom sessions and engagement with other non-assessed learning activities do not count towards the final grade, these activities are designed to be an integral part of achieving the course learning outcomes.

If you receive a grade of ‘incomplete’ after turning in an assessed project, you will have the opportunity to resubmit your project once. Please note, receiving a grade of “Incomplete” and/or failure to demonstrate a learning outcome will not result in a refund.

To officially complete the course, you must complete all 6 modules and submit your acknowledgement of course completion in the final module. This will ensure your work will be graded.

---
## Certification
Once you receive confirmation you have successfully met the learning objectives for your project, you will receive your certificate of completion. This typically happens one week after the course has ended to allow time for grading. You will receive an email inviting you to download your certificate and you can view/print your certificate of completion.

Along with the course completion certificate, students will be awarded 3.0 Continuing Education Units (CEUs). Students will not receive University credit for completing the course as this is a non-credit course.
