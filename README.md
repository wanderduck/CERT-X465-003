## Course Modules

### **<u>Week 1</u>: Start with a question**
- Sometimes you’ll start with a question and then need to find data to answer it. Other times, you will have data and need to understand how to use it to make decisions. Regardless of the starting point, it’s important to be really clear what you’re setting out to answer.
- In this module, we will learn how to identify and clearly frame problems and questions that can be addressed through quantitative data. You will think about the downstream value of the data investigation and the uses it can have for different audiences and decision-makers<br><br>

#### <u>**Assignments**</u>:
- Question identification: Think of a topic area that interests you (i.e., something you do for work, a hobby, something you enjoy). Now think about a problem or question about this topic that can be answered using data.
<br><br>

### **<u>Week 2</u>: Finding data and assessing quality**
- We will learn how to identify potential data sources to help answer a question or problem of interest. There are a lot of places to look for data. Some might contain raw data, and some might have data that’s already been tabulated or analyzed. In addition to locating data, we will discuss how to evaluate data quality and how to vet data sources to interpret what they can and cannot tell you.<br><br>

#### <u>**Assignments**</u>:
- Data source identification and assessment: Identify at least one data source that can help answer the question you developed in Module 1. First, brainstorm a bit on your own. Then, try using AI to identify data sources.
<br><br>

### **<u>Week 3</u>: Deriving insights from your data**
- In this module, we will focus on how to find key points and draw conclusions from data - the translation of information into knowledge. We will also learn how diverse perspectives can enrich and add nuance to data interpretation.<br><br>

#### <u>**Assignments**</u>:
- Data interpretation video: Using the data source(s) that you identified, produce a 5-minute video describing what you are seeing in the data and what conclusions the data is pointing towards. Make sure you tie it back to the original question you set out to address.
<br><br>

### **<u>Week 4</u>: Interpreting graphs and visuals**
- Data is sometimes presented in tables or as raw numbers, but more commonly, it is displayed as visuals. We will learn how to interpret what a data visualization is trying to convey, and how well it does at conveying that information. We will draw on principles of data visualization best practices to determine how to construct an effective visual that can be interpreted easily by different audiences.<br><br>

#### <u>**Assignments**</u>:
- Data visualization analysis: Find two data visualizations online - one that you think is a good, effective visual and one that you think is less effective. Note that these do not need to be about the same topic your other assignments have focused on.
<br><br>

### **<u>Week 5</u>: Making and presenting data-driven recommendations**
- You’ve started to glean insights from your data in Module 3. Now, we’re going to move from knowledge to wisdom by formulating strong data-driven recommendations or takeaways. We will learn about how to present these takeaways to different audiences and will apply this by drafting a brief report and oral presentation of your recommendations that are tied to your original problem or question.<br><br>

#### <u>**Assignments**</u>:
- **Report for stakeholders**:
	- <u>Part 1</u>:  You’ve developed your question, found your data, and interpreted it. Now, we’re going to put it all together. Write a brief report to a clearly-specified audience that contains at least three recommendations or takeaways that are justified by data.
	- <u>Part 2</u>: Next, record a 5-min video where you present your recommendations in a mock professional setting. This is your “elevator speech” version of your key takeaways. Provide feedback on two of your peers’ videos.
<br><br>

### **<u>Week 6</u>: Using business intelligence and dashboards**
- Business intelligence is a combination of tools and methods that allow businesses to harness data for decision making. We will learn how business intelligence might be used in an organization and what players, including IT, might be involved. We will also focus on a commonly used tool in business intelligence: dashboards, or tools that allow people to interact with a large amount of data or track changes in real time.<br><br>

#### <u>**Assignments**</u>:
- **Reflection**: Discussion board reflecting on what you learned and what you are going to take away from this class.

## Course Completion
You will receive a grade of incomplete or complete based on your demonstration of course learning objectives. Learning objectives are demonstrated by completing assessed projects.

The instructor will assess each learning outcome as “not demonstrated,” or “demonstrated.” Completion of a course means that you have demonstrated achievement of all learning outcomes. Continuing Education Units (CEUs) and the certificate of completion for the course will be awarded only if you receive a grade of ‘complete’ for the course.

While participation in Zoom sessions and engagement with other non-assessed learning activities do not count towards the final grade, these activities are designed to be an integral part of achieving the course learning outcomes.

If you receive a grade of ‘incomplete’ after turning in an assessed project, you will have the opportunity to resubmit your project once. Please note, receiving a grade of “Incomplete” and/or failure to demonstrate a learning outcome will not result in a refund.

To officially complete the course, you must complete all 6 modules and submit your acknowledgement of course completion in the final module. This will ensure your work will be graded.

---
## Certification
Once you receive confirmation you have successfully met the learning objectives for your project, you will receive your certificate of completion. This typically happens one week after the course has ended to allow time for grading. You will receive an email inviting you to download your certificate and you can view/print your certificate of completion.

Along with the course completion certificate, students will be awarded 3.0 Continuing Education Units (CEUs). Students will not receive University credit for completing the course as this is a non-credit course.

##### Essay
There is an online, data science and machine learning platform called Kaggle where organizations and users can submit different forms of competitions with datasets where users or teams of users compete to best solve whatever goal is set for the competition. For example, an introductory competition held previously was to build a model that can, based on the data given, best predict whether an individual will pay back or default on a home loan. Within this sphere I am most concerned with the *meta* of the competitions. That is, questions such as: 
 
- What coding languages and code libraries are most often used?
- What types of models and machine learning platforms are most regularly used to win competitions?
- Are competition winners most often individuals or teams?
- Are these winners professionals or amateurs in the fields of machine learning and data science?
- What types of hardware are being used, and do winners most often use professional/corporate level hardware or is average enthusiast hardware enough?

My interest in this topic stems chiefly from the concern that I want to know if an individual amateur such as myself with mid to lower high-end hardware has some chance at winning any of these competitions. Many of the competitions have cash prizes for the top performers/teams. Likewise, performing well in a competition can be a stepping stone into a career in related fields, as many companies not only sponsor competitions but keep an eye on top performers for potential talent. Lastly, one can learn a great deal from the experience of building, training, and implementing a machine learning model in these competitions without needing to think of interesting problems to solve and compiling a dataset (or datasets) themselves, which can often be a barrier to learning and skill growth. 

Answering the questions above will give clearer context into how one ought to pursue competing in these competitions and, furthermore, whether, given one's unique circumstances and the resources available to them, whether attempting to compete in these competitions is worth their time and effort. Likewise, these questions could help inform competition organizers and the team at Kaggle on how to better structure and limit competitions depending on what categories of competitor they most want competing in particular competitions. Overall, this type of investigation can give insight into how the platform has evolved and changed over its approximately fifteen year existence.

### <u>Assignment 2A Submission</u>
#### Assignment 02A
- Completed by: Logan R. Sloan<br><br>

##### Assignment Details
Identify at least one data source that can help answer the question you developed in Module 1. First, do some research on your own to try and find a data source(s). You might start with a simple Google search, you may ask someone who has knowledge in the area, or you might already know of some candidates. For example, if your question pertains to K-12 education in Minnesota, you might check out the Department of Education's data sources.

After you have finished your search and identified good data source(s), please write a short essay that addresses to the following questions: 
- Describe the data source(s) that you found.
- How is the data relevant to your question?
- Where does the data come from?
- How reliable is the source? Are there any signs of bias?<br><br>

##### Essay
To address my questions from [Assignment 1](####assignment-01) I have found a primary dataset called “Meta Kaggle” ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/meta-kaggle)) that also has an extension called “Meta Kaggle Code” ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/meta-kaggle-code)). The primary dataset contains all the public data on Kaggle’s competitions, kernels and models used, organizations who posted competitions, data concerning the users and teams who competed, the datasets used for competitions, among other things. The “Meta Kaggle Code” dataset contains all the raw source code of Python and R coding language notebooks used to analyze datasets, make submissions to competitions, or where otherwise uploaded to Kaggle’s website. The data contained in these two datasets are directly the kind of data necessary to analyze the details of Kaggle competitions and those who win these competitions, which is ultimately what my questions from Assignment 1 are attempting to find out. This data was gathered and released by the team at Kaggle, so it can be assumed the data is reliable. Furthermore, there does not seem to be any bias in the data, though only a full scraping of the website, which would take a very long time, immense compute resources and is outside the scope of this project, could truly tell if any bias existed in the gathering of the data. However, since all of the data gathered is publicly available and can be checked against the dataset, it would seem that bias in the data is unlikely.
